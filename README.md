# SalamaThanksV3 Beta Testing

The goal of this beta testing round is to gather consumer-based comments for the first version of the SalamaThanks Web Application. This round spans three (3) days, starting on June 8, 2022 (Wednesday), up until June 10, 2022 (Friday). The feedback form will be open until June 10, 11:59 PM.


The web app should be able to:
- receive input and return output
- swap languages using the two-arrow button
- clear input using the X button
- copy output using the duplicate button
- receive speech input and convert to text
- return speech output from text
- redirect to the beta testing forms using the feedback button


The current limitations of the web app are:
- a character limit of 250
- occasional inability to access the Speech-to-Text feature (less compared to version 2)
